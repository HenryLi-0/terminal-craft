wow, new repository, what's this for? yep, another hack club YSWS. im gonna try to speedrun this one in two days! (i did another one in 2 hours and another one in 15 minutes before...)

basically, make something in the terminal! and since the YSWS is called `terminal-craft`, that's exactly what im gonna try to do. terminal craft. like 3d minecraft in the terminal (2d is silly)
